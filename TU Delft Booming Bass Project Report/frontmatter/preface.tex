\textit{
This final report presents the culmination of efforts undertaken by our mentorate group B2 to design, analyze, and build a comprehensive sound amplifier system named "the Booming Bass Sound System." This Integrated Project was a collaborative endeavor aimed at integrating theoretical knowledge from various courses, Linear Circuit A \& B, with practical skills acquired from past CourseLabs sessions to create a fully functional audio amplification system capable of delivering high-quality sound amplification.}

\textit{Throughout the project, the group engaged in a structured process that involved detailed research, systematic design, iterative simulation, and rigorous testing of the various subsystems. The sound amplifying system was developed through the collaboration of subteams, each tasked with designing different specific components, including the power supply, power amplifier, sound filters, and, as a result, the complete loudspeaker system. All these components/subsystems played a crucial role in achieving the desired sound amplifier system performance.}

\textit{The project also served as an educational opportunity to apply and deepen our understanding of different electrical engineering concepts, such as circuit design, frequency response analysis, and signal processing. By working collaboratively, we gained insights into project management, teamwork, and problem-solving, which were instrumental in overcoming various technical challenges throughout the first Integrated Project.}

\textit{This final report consolidates the work of all subteams of the mentor group B2, focusing on the design and implementation of all the different subsystems. It includes detailed analyses of key principles of all the subsystems and performance measurements and comparing theoretical, simulated, and experimental results. Additionally, the report discusses the rationale for critical design decisions and highlights the acoustic characterization of the complete sound amplifying system.}

\textit{We extend our gratitude to our tutor, H.E.J. Bosma, teaching assistant, M. Mihankhah, and professors, whose guidance and feedback were invaluable throughout the project. Their expertise, knowledge, and insight helped us navigate the complexities of the design process and encouraged us to achieve excellence and certainty in our work. Furthermore, we acknowledge the contributions of all group members whose dedication and collaboration made this project successful in the end.}

\textit{It is our hope that this report provides a clear and thorough account of the Booming Bass Sound System Project and serves as a testament to the knowledge and skills we have developed during this academic journey of our first year in electrical engineering.
